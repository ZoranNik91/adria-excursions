        There is the highest lighthouse on Adria (42 meter high), peaceful shinglebeaches which are a perfect place for
        snorkeling.
        This place has everything what you need for perfect relaxiation:
        a beautiul view to open Sea, peaceful place without masstourism,
        a lot of natural shadow and a beach bar. You have 3 hours free time on the Island.
